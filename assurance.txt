I’m here for you.
You’re not alone.
This is not your fault.
What kind of thoughts are you having?
I care.
Your life matters to me.
I understand.
You matter.
Have you told your doctor how you are feeling?
You don't walk this path alone.
I believe in you.
You're awesome!
I'm here if you want to talk.
Things will change.
You won't feel this way forever.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm not going to abandon you.
I love you.
It will pass, we can ride it out together.
When all this is over, I'll still be here.
You're not crazy.
God does not play dice with the universe.
May the strength of the past reflect in your future.
I understand your pain and I empathize.
You are important to me.
I can't imagine what it's like for you.
If you need a friend, I'm here.
It's okay to feel this way.
I appreciate you.
You are enough.
You're strong.
